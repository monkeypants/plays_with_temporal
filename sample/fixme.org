#+STARTUP: overview

* Sample Domain Technical Debt Tasks

This file manages executable tasks for technical debt specific to the sample/ domain. Cross-domain issues are tracked in the root fixme.org file.

All tasks follow the methodology documented in memory-bank/methodology.org and maintain Clean Architecture boundaries from memory-bank/systemPatterns.org.

** Active Sample Domain Tasks

*** NEXT Remove Sample Empty Files
Clean up obsolete empty files specific to sample domain, following file-centric task definition from memory-bank/methodology.org.

**** Architectural Rationale
Empty files from architectural evolution create confusion and violate intentional code organization. These sample-specific files are no longer needed after moving to the three-layer repository pattern documented in memory-bank/systemPatterns.org.

**** Files to create/modify
- `sample/converters.py`: Remove empty file
- `sample/temporal_repositories.py`: Remove empty file
- `sample/minio_repositories.py`: Remove empty file

**** Completion Criteria
- [ ] All three empty sample files are removed
- [ ] No import errors occur in sample domain after removal
- [ ] All sample tests pass after cleanup
- [ ] No references to removed files exist in sample codebase

*** TODO Implement Sample File Upload Security
Add comprehensive security measures for sample domain file uploads through FileStorageRepository, maintaining Clean Architecture boundaries.

**** Architectural Rationale
Current sample file upload endpoints lack security validation, violating security best practices. Per memory-bank/systemPatterns.org Large Payload Handling Pattern, file uploads must use FileStorageRepository with security measures implemented in repository layer.

**** Files to create/modify
- `sample/repos/minio/file_storage.py`: Add file size limits, content-type validation, malicious content scanning
- `sample/api/app.py`: Remove direct file handling from upload_order_attachment endpoint
- `sample/domain.py`: Add FileUploadSecurityArgs model with validation rules
- `sample/tests/api/test_file_upload_security.py`: Add security validation tests

**** Completion Criteria
- [ ] File size limits enforced in MinioFileStorageRepository
- [ ] Content-type validation against actual file content
- [ ] Malicious file upload prevention
- [ ] API endpoints delegate all file operations to FileStorageRepository
- [ ] Security tests pass for all file upload scenarios

*** TODO Fix Sample File Streaming Performance
Implement streaming file operations in sample domain following Large Payload Handling Pattern from memory-bank/systemPatterns.org.

**** Architectural Rationale
Current sample file operations load entire files into memory, violating the Large Payload Handling Pattern. Should implement streaming through FileStorageRepository to handle large files efficiently without memory exhaustion.

**** Files to create/modify
- `sample/repos/minio/file_storage.py`: Implement streaming upload/download methods
- `sample/api/app.py`: Update file endpoints to use streaming operations
- `sample/domain.py`: Add streaming-specific models and validation
- `sample/tests/api/test_file_streaming.py`: Add streaming performance tests

**** Completion Criteria
- [ ] File upload supports streaming for large files
- [ ] File download returns streaming response
- [ ] Memory usage remains constant regardless of file size
- [ ] All file operations use FileStorageRepository streaming methods
- [ ] Performance tests validate streaming behavior

*** TODO Improve Sample E2E Test Reliability
Fix sample domain E2E test reliability issues following Testing Strategy Pattern from memory-bank/systemPatterns.org.

**** Architectural Rationale
Current sample E2E tests have reliability issues with hardcoded timeouts and poor error handling. Per memory-bank/systemPatterns.org Testing Strategy Pattern, E2E tests should be minimal, reliable, and focus on critical paths.

**** Files to create/modify
- `sample/tests/e2e/test_order_fulfillment.py`: Implement exponential backoff, better error handling
- `sample/tests/e2e/conftest.py`: Add test cleanup utilities and timeout configuration
- `sample/tests/e2e/test_order_cancellation.py`: Fix timeout and polling issues
- `sample/tests/e2e/utils.py`: Create E2E test utilities for reliable polling

**** Completion Criteria
- [ ] E2E tests use exponential backoff instead of fixed intervals
- [ ] Configurable timeouts based on environment
- [ ] Proper cleanup of created orders/files after test execution
- [ ] Robust error handling in all E2E test scenarios
- [ ] E2E tests pass consistently in slow environments

** Completed Sample Domain Tasks

*** DONE Example Completed Task
This section will contain completed sample domain tasks moved from active sections above.

** Implementation Notes

*** Task Execution Guidelines
- Only work on tasks marked NEXT (following memory-bank/methodology.org)
- Each task focuses on single architectural boundary within sample domain
- All changes must maintain Clean Architecture principles
- Cross-reference memory-bank/systemPatterns.org for implementation patterns

*** Sample Domain Quality Standards
- Repository changes must follow exact three-layer pattern
- Security fixes implemented in repository layer, not API layer
- Performance improvements must not violate Large Payload Handling Pattern
- E2E tests should be minimal and focus on critical sample domain paths

*** Success Metrics
- All tasks have concrete completion criteria with specific sample files
- File changes are explicitly specified for sample domain
- Architectural rationale references memory bank documentation
- Tasks can be executed independently without scope creep in sample domain
