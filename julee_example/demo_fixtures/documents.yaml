      Meeting Transcript - Q1 Planning Session
      Date: March 15, 2024
      Time: 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM
      Attendees: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Mike Rodriguez (Engineering Lead),
      Lisa Wang (Designer)

      Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining. Let's kick off our Q1 planning. Mike,
      can you give us an update on the current sprint?

      Mike: Sure, we're about 80% through sprint 23. We've completed the user
      authentication module and are working on the data migration tool. Should be
      done by Friday.

      Lisa: Great! I've finished the mockups for the dashboard redesign. Sarah,
      have you had a chance to review them?

      Sarah: Yes, they look fantastic. I especially like the new navigation
      structure. When can we start implementation?

      Mike: I'd estimate 2 weeks for the frontend work, plus another week for
      backend API changes.

      Lisa: I can start on the component library updates while Mike works on the
      APIs.

      Sarah: Perfect. Let's also discuss the customer feedback integration. We had
      47 responses to our survey.

      Mike: The main requests were for better reporting and mobile optimization.

      Sarah: Those should be our next priorities then. Lisa, can you start
      sketching mobile designs?

      Lisa: Absolutely. I'll have initial concepts by next Tuesday.

      Sarah: Excellent. Any other items?

      Mike: Just a heads up that we'll need to schedule downtime for the database
      migration, probably next weekend.

      Sarah: Noted. I'll coordinate with support. Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.
