Attendees: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Mike Rodriguez (Engineering Lead),
Lisa Wang (Designer)

Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining. Let's kick off our Q1 planning. Mike,
can you give us an update on the current sprint?

Mike: Sure, we're about 80% through sprint 23. We've completed the user
authentication module and are working on the data migration tool. Should be
done by Friday.

Lisa: Great! I've finished the mockups for the dashboard redesign. Sarah,
have you had a chance to review them?

Sarah: Yes, they look fantastic. I especially like the new navigation
structure. When can we start implementation?

Mike: I'd estimate 2 weeks for the frontend work, plus another week for
backend API changes.

Lisa: I can start on the component library updates while Mike works on the
APIs.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's also discuss the customer feedback integration. We had
47 responses to our survey.

Mike: The main requests were for better reporting and mobile optimization.

Sarah: Those should be our next priorities then. Lisa, can you start
sketching mobile designs?

Lisa: Absolutely. I'll have initial concepts by next Tuesday.

Sarah: Excellent. Any other items?

Mike: Just a heads up that we'll need to schedule downtime for the database
migration, probably next weekend.

Sarah: Noted. I'll coordinate with support. Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.
